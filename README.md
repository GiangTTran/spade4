# SPADE4
Implementation of Sparsity and Delay Embedding based Forecasting of Epidemics (SPADE4)

## Problem Statement
Given data ${y(t_k)}_{k=1}^m$ corresponding to the solution of a multidimensional dynamical system based on epidemic models (daily active cases or cumulative cases), we aim to predict $y(t)$ over a short-term forecasting window.
